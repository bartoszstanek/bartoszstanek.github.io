  Hi, Iâ€™m Bartosz, a <mark>renewable engineer</mark>, and a huge enthusiast of <mark>renewable energy sources</mark>, energy storage and new technologies.
  
  My fascination with <mark>RES</mark> technology started almost nine years ago when I decided to study <mark>power and environmental engineering</mark> I graduated from the <mark>Silesian University of Technology</mark> with a BSc Eng. and after an MSc Eng. where I focused on the study of <mark>solar technologies</mark>. Currently, I have been working as a <mark>Renewable Energy Researcher</mark> for almost 5 years, where as part of my <mark>PhD</mark> I am investigating parabolic trough collectors, PV panels, energy storage systems and other technologies related to clean energy generation.
  
  During this period I have acquired extensive technical <mark>theoretical</mark> and <mark>practical</mark> knowledge of energy devices and systems. I have <mark>comprehensively designed and built a solar radiation simulator</mark> and participated in the development of many other research test stations.
  
  Additionally, to researching individual technologies, I developed analyses of entire <mark>energy systems</mark> and their integration. I have performed <mark>long-term analyses</mark> for installations based on energy potential data a feasibility studies.
  
  I have experience collaborating with the industry supported by several collaborative projects and scientific articles. A significant opportunity for development has been the international collaboration with <mark>KTH Royal Institute of Technology</mark>, where I held the position of visiting researcher.

  Currently based in Katowice, Poland. Open for Relocation.
